##Obesity Prevalence
We are considering data from the 2008-201 Scottish Health Surveys on socio-economic and lifestyle factors.

Our main questions of interest are:
 - Has the prevalence of obesity in Scotland changed over the given years of the Scottish Health Survey?
 - Are there any differences in obesity by age, gender, socio-economic status or lifestyle factors?

We will conduct exploratory and formal analysis and present our findings in a report.
