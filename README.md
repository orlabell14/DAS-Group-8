##Obesity Prevalence
We are considering data from the 2008-2012 Scottish Health Surveys on socio-economic and lifestyle factors.

We are investigating two main questions of interest;
 - Has the prevalence of obesity in Scotland changed over the time period of the survey?
 - Are there any differences in obesity by factors such as age, sex, socio-economic status or others?

We first conducted exploratory analysis to investigate if there were any patterns or outliers in the data by creating plots and summaries by age, sex, and socio-economic status. Additionally, we created a time series plot to investigate the first question of interest.
We then conducted formal analysis to look into the second question of interest by creating models and assessing their significance compared to the null model.

Our analysis and relevant conclusions are presented in the report 'Group_8_Analysis.qmd'.
